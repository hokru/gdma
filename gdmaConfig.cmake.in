# gdmaConfig.cmake
# ------------------
#
# GDMA cmake module.
# This module sets the following variables in your project:
#
# ::
#
##   gdma_FOUND - true if gdma and all required components found on the system
##   gdma_VERSION - gdma version in format Major.Minor.Release
##   gdma_INCLUDE_DIRS - Directories where gdma header is located.
##   gdma_INCLUDE_DIR - same as DIRS
##XXXgdma_DEFINITIONS: Definitions necessary to use XXX.h
##   gdma_LIBRARIES - gdma library to link against.
##   gdma_LIBRARY - same as LIBRARIES
#
#
# Available components: shared static
#
# ::
#
#   shared - search for only shared library
#   static - search for only static library
#
#
# Exported targets:
#
# ::
#
##   int - main libint and libderiv libraries
#
#
# Suggested usage:
#
# ::
#
##   find_package(libint)
##   find_package(libint 1.1.6 EXACT CONFIG REQUIRED COMPONENTS shared 6)
#
#
# The following variables can be set to guide the search for this package:
#
# ::
#
#   gdma_DIR - CMake variable, set to directory containing this Config file
#   CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH - CMake variable, set to root directory of this package
#   PATH - environment variable, set to bin directory of this package
